planning env. in vr
   This project is covering to planning or designing some topic with virtual reality. Specially i needed. if you are like me , like a thinking 
   multiple projects at the same time and jumping between them.while later you are forgeting about huge details.planning vr will show you virtual
   reality enviroments. it will has browser and document options. google sync with voice and wikipedia plugins.360* degree interactive enviroment.
   you can categorize your topics everywhere in VR with the cool templates. Sadly unity engine html render support is really poor in these days.
